          <blockquote>
            Col. Chris Hadfield (Commander of the ISS) came briefly to the university to give a talk before becoming an adjunct professor. Knowing beforehand that he had no time afterwards for a photo op, I set up a backdrop and lights beforehand and told his manager I would only need 30 seconds for a photo. He finished his talk, <a href="https://juil.me/photojournalism">I got the shot</a>, and he rushed off to the airport leaving me with one of my favourite celebrity portraits to this day.</blockquote>

          <h4>Door to Door Sales</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Learned to build rapport with uninterested, harrowed, and sometimes outright hostile customers.</li>
            <li>Maintained decent sales while preserving <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/1656865/canadian-energy-company-stalked-by-controversy-over-its-sales-methods/">my integrity</a>. I always discussed their current energy costs, and never sold the service to anyone who would not benefit.</li>

            Increased personal sales output 1.5x by targeting specifically wealthy streets in each neighbourhood where there were large houses that would have the biggest ROI from a fixed monthly energy bill.
