          <h3>Imprint Publications • Waterloo, ON</h3>
          <h5>January 2014 - December 2014</h5>
          <h4>Head Photo Editor &amp; Photographer</h4>
          <p>As the Photo Editor of the University of Waterloo's student newspaper, I curated the photos used in print and online, organized and delegated work with other photographers on the team, and made sure that only the most representative and highest quality photos were published in print and online. I also took many of the photos myself.</p>
          <p>I learned to work under pressure and deadlines.</p>

          <h4>LA Lifestyle/Fashion Photoshoot <span class="date">2015</span></h4>
          <p>Within one week I put together a team of clothing, swimsuit, and accessory designers, four models, and a makeup artist on my own in order to pull off a lifestyle and fashion photo shoot.</p>
          <p>My experience recruiting and organizing people at Imprint kept me level-headed and I executed the shoot smoothly.</p>

          <h4>Mike the Barber <span class="date">2015</span></h4>
          <p>I produced a promotional video for Mike the Barber under tight equipment and time constraints. Despite only having a single model and limited time, the result was visually interesting.</p>
