            <li>Curated the photos used in print and online.</li>
            <li>Collaborated with other editors, designers, and writers to create compelling and informative stories.</li>

          </ul>
          <blockquote>Col. Chris Hadfield (Commander of the ISS) came briefly to the university to give a talk before taking a job there. Knowing beforehand that he had no time afterwards for a photo op, I set up a backdrop and lights beforehand and told his manager I would only need 30 seconds for a photo. He finished his talk, I got the shot, and he rushed off to the airport leaving me with one of my favourite celebrity portraits to this day.</blockquote>

          <p>Within one week I put together a team of clothing, swimsuit, and accessory designers, four models, and a makeup artist on my own in order to pull off a lifestyle and fashion photo shoot.</p>
          <p>My experience recruiting and organizing people at Imprint kept me level-headed and I executed the shoot smoothly.</p>
